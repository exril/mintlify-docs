# Permissions : 
Grave's default permissions are designed to be simple and clear, ensuring basic functionality across most scenarios. However, these default permissions may not always meet specific needs, such as when using the bot in a private voice channel or other restricted settings. In such cases, we encourage customizing the permissions to ensure the bot operates seamlessly in your unique environment
